# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Advent of Code 2025 solutions repository. The repository is currently empty and awaiting initial setup.

## Repository Management

This repository uses `jj` (Jujutsu) for version control alongside git. Both `.git` and `.jj` directories are present. When making commits or managing version control, be aware that the user may be using `jj` commands rather than standard git commands.

## Common Patterns for Advent of Code

When implementing solutions:
- Each day typically has two parts (part 1 and part 2)
- Input files are usually provided as text files
- Solutions should read input from files rather than hardcoding
- Test inputs are often provided in problem descriptions for validation

## File Organization

The structure will likely evolve as solutions are added. Common patterns include:
- Organizing by day (day01, day02, etc.)
- Separating input files from solution code
- Including example/test inputs alongside actual puzzle inputs
